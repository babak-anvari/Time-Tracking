# Time-Tracking-Software
Time tracking web application is a time management tool to track time for different actions of projects based on hours entered by users. Users would be able to log in hours spent on each task in a format of a weekly timesheet. These timesheets could be used for project management and financial purposes.

## Installation
First, install the programs required to run the application:

[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Next, clone this repository and install dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/babak-anvari/Time-Tracking`

`npm install`

Make sure MongoDB is running.

Next, start the test environment with the following command:

`npm run test`

The application should open automatically. 

New users should register with a new email address and use the same email address to sign in the application. Registered users can define new projects, create new actions and assign actions to each project. People can enter their everyday tasks into the timesheet. Timesheets are identified based on the week end date (Saturday of each week) and can be updated or modified at any time.

Enjoy!
